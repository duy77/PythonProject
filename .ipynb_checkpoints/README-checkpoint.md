# PythonProject
Notebook structure
It is best to think about your final project as a data-driven report. You will need to put everything into a Jupyter notebook with the following structure:

Introduction: Introduce the project, and your approach, talk about the process of how you came up with the metric and some alternatives you may have explored.

Our project tries to find the “best” neighborhood in Pittsburgh. To do that, we came up with some metric like good school district, housing value, household income, less criminal, more entertainment compared to another neighborhood, air quality, parks or more green area is more than another place. But some metrics don’t have the data or hard to find the data in csv, tsv file in the range City of Pittsburgh. Ex: school rate, air quality or air pollution…

The Metric: Describe your metric, and what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?
Our metric are housing value, criminal… 

The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.

Conclusion: Reflect on how the data-driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this.
